# Bug: if word count of userwordinput is too small or too large, the program will not run because of the variable section.
# Solution: random userwordinput number and giving each line a variable to be called on for accuracy check

# Implement true vs false counter to calculate accuracy of the found results vs the users search query.
# Implement exact phrase search. Keeps all puncuation and upper/lower case for exact finds.
# Implement make all text lower case

import re

# User input phrase and find words that are saved as variables
userphraseinput = "communication goals, detecting test, avoiding stereotypes, and test conflict"
userwordinput = "communication goals, detecting deception, avoiding stereotypes, and reducing conflict"

# Clean up text for easier search
userphraselist = userphraseinput.replace(",", "").replace(".", "")
userwordlist = userwordinput.replace(",", "").replace(".", "")

words_to_match = userwordinput.split()

for word in words_to_match:
    pattern = re.compile(r'\b{}\b'.format(word))
    if re.search(pattern, userphraseinput):
        print("true".format(word))
    else:
        print("false".format(word))
